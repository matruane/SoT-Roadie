Roadie is a group project coming out from Summer of Tech Create Camp 2018 - an event participated by around 50 coding and design students in Wellington and many volunteering mentors from the industry. Within 2 days, we formed into groups of 5, pitched our ideas and built an app.

Roadie uses Vanilla Javascript with a simple Express server calling Google distance API and NZ FuelSaver API which enables users to enter their car plate, select a destination and get an estimated fuel cost for their NZ road trip.

Our most treasured learning outcome from this project is to work in a team with different stacks, how to agree on ideas, how to distribute tasks so that everyone has a chance to learn and contribute. We practised lots and lots of Agile (small sprints, hourly standups, reflections etc) and empathy to make this project happen.
